# ComfyUI with ROCm Docker (AMD GPUs)

This repository provides a Dockerized environment for running **[ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)** on **AMD GPUs** using **ROCm**. It includes a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml` configured for hardware acceleration and easy deployment on systems with supported AMD GPUs.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Full ROCm support** for AMD GPUs (tested with ROCm 6.4).
- Installs and runs **ComfyUI** in a containerized environment.
- Downloads and sets up the **Stable Diffusion 1.5** model automatically.
- Includes **ComfyUI Manager** plugin for enhanced UI node management.
- Designed to work with Docker Compose for simple setup.

---

## üõ† Prerequisites
- AMD GPU with ROCm-compatible architecture (see table below).
- ROCm drivers installed on the host. [Install ROCm ‚Üí](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/quick-start.html#rocm-installation)
- Docker and Docker Compose installed.

## üß∞ Build and Run

### üîß Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t comfyui-rocm .
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start the Container

```bash
docker compose up
```

Then open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:8188](http://localhost:8188)

## üìÅ Mounted Volumes

You can customize the bound directories to your likings. Keep in mind that the directories are owned by docker / root,
so you might need elevated permissions to write into those directories, e.g. copying new models.

---

## üß™ Tested With

- ROCm 6.4 on Fedora 42 (KDE)
- AMD Radeon RX 6600m
- Docker Engine 24+
- Docker Compose v2+

---

## üìù Notes

- Set the `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION` variable according to your GPU architecture if needed.
- Make sure ROCm is functioning correctly on the host (`rocminfo`, `clinfo`, etc.).
- If using a different ROCm version, update the `amdgpu-install` package URL accordingly.
